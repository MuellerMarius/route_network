## Instructions

You can enter airport pairs on the **Data Edit** page by using the respective four letter [ICAO airport codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO_airport_code) and assign a category to it. To just view a basic example simply _Load sample data_.  The **Map Display** page then shows all the entered routings and allows the user to view the whole network of flights that e.g. he has taken.
